After its launch, it started to be used \\nby many users for different fields of interest. Several scientific articles have even been published \\nin which ChatGPT appears as an author because text generated by him was used. The impact \\nit had on technology is enormous and that is why many materials have been published on how \\nto use it in different fields as well as in different usage scenarios.In this material, we carry out \\nan analysis of the materials that were published in three months after the appearance of \\nChatGPT (December 2022, January 2023 and February 2023). For this synthesis, the materials \\nindexed by Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science were analyzed. Within the analyzed \\nmaterials, scenarios of using ChatGPT and how to interact with it are identified. We also \\npresent the way of involvement or use of ChatGPT in education, science and research and in \\nthe final part of the material we present some suggestions for future research that can be \\ncarried out with the help of ChatGPT. \\nKeywords: ChatGPT, OpenAI, Papers, Research, Review \\nDOI: 10.24818/issn14531305/27.1.2023.01 \\n \\nIntroduction \\nLaunched recently, ChatGPT ended up \\nhaving a lot of users in a very short time, and \\nthat\\'s because we\\'re living in a time when \\nartificial intelligence is born and ended up \\nbeing used in a beneficial way for users. Its \\npurpose is to understand and generate human-\\nlike text in response to natural language input, \\nand it can perform tasks such as language \\ntranslation, text completion, and question \\nanswering. Its capabilities are achieved by \\ntraining on large data sets so that it can learn \\npatterns and relationships in language without \\nexplicit supervision. Certain researchers argue \\nthat this stage is as important for the \\nappearance of electric current, or the \\nappearance of the mobile phone or any other \\nmagnificent appearance in history. \\nIt is very important to adapt in any field and \\nbe able to use new technologies as well as this \\nnew artificial intelligence technology in our \\nfields of interest. \\nAfter the appearance of ChatGPT, many \\narticles appeared in which its use is presented \\nfor solving problems in different fields. In this \\narticle we present materials that have \\nappeared on the use of ChatGPT in areas such \\nas education, health, Internet of Things, \\nFinance and Investments as well as in the \\nacademic writing part. For some articles \\nChatGPT even appears as the author, although \\nthis is not accepted by some researchers, and \\nshould normally be given as the reference for \\nthat article. Also in this material we perform \\nan analysis of Web of Science indexed \\npublications and Scopus indexed publications \\nthrough which we want to present the high \\ndegree of publication of materials that use \\nChatGPT. \\n \\n2 Number of the ChatGPT related \\npublications \\n2.1 Publications on Scopus \\nA search of the term ChatGPT among Scopus \\nmaterials found 59 materials published in the \\nperiod 2022 – 2023 (February).

For this reason, we \\nwill not perform analysis on them, but only \\npresent the analyzes performed for the \\nmaterials indexed on Web of Science and \\nScopus. \\n \\n3 Domains and areas of using ChatGPT \\nChatGPT is used in many areas and the \\nobtained results are presented in papers that \\napproach different domains. In this chapter, \\nwe present the most used domains for \\nChatGPT. \\n \\n3.1 ChatGPT and Education environment \\nChatGPT has influenced the educational field, \\nand some papers that are published in the first \\nthree months after the launch of ChatGPT try \\nto answer to the next question: How could \\nChatGPT \\ninfluence \\nthe \\neducational \\nenvironment? \\n51\\n30\\n453\\n217\\n63\\n56\\n106\\n48\\n21\\n160\\n308\\n7\\n5\\n28\\n215\\n0\\n50\\n100\\n150\\n200\\n250\\n300\\n350\\n400\\n450\\n500\\nInformatica Economică vol. 27, no. 1/2023 \\n \\n9 \\nIn [18] the authors present the way this \\nartificial intelligence model works together \\nwith the advantages and disadvantages of its \\nuse. It also provides answers on how ChatGPT \\nshould be used to help both students and \\nteachers in order to optimize the learning \\nprocess. According to [18], ChatGPT could \\nhelp the learning process due to the tutoring it \\ncan offer to students and its ability to adapt \\ninformation corresponding to the level of \\nquestions received from the user, the \\ntranslation of educational materials can also \\nhelp foreign students, the interactive mode of \\nthis model is another strong point because this \\nis one of the best learning methods for a \\nstudent. The author also states that studies \\nhave demonstrated that this model can \\nautomate the scoring of grade essays with a \\ncorrelation of 0.86 and it was able to identify \\nkey features of well-written essays. On the \\nother hand, some of the disadvantages of this \\nmodel were also identified even by ChatGPT \\nitself: lack of human interaction, limited \\nunderstanding, \\nconfidentiality, \\nlimited \\ncreativity. \\nChatGPT \\ncan \\nrepresent \\nan \\nextraordinary tool for learning, used as a \\nmethod for deepening information, but it \\ncould not replace education in academic \\nenvironments. It must be taken into account \\nthat due to its serious limitations, it has \\nsometimes happened to generate erroneous \\nanswers, even making references to non-\\nexistent articles. It also led some teachers to \\nrethink the way of evaluating students. \\nIn [19] the author presents the need for \\nresponsible and ethical use of artificial \\nintelligence, respectively the ChatGPT model \\nin the educational environment. It states that \\nthe implementation of the ChatGPT model in \\neducational environments plays a significant \\nrole in terms of optimizing educational \\nexperiences, \\nbut \\nemphasizes \\nthat \\nthe \\ntechnology must be used responsibly and \\nethically. According to him, the ChatGPT \\nmodel should be used to complement the \\ninformation the students have, but not to \\nreplace the need to learn. It is necessary to \\nensure that students will continue to develop \\ntheir ability to think critically and find \\nsolutions to problems, as well as taking \\nmeasures to reduce any existing prejudices \\nand forms of discrimination. Regarding \\nresponsible use, the author states that many \\nteachers are considering rethinking the way \\nstudents are evaluated to avoid as much as \\npossible the use of artificial intelligence by \\nstudents in this process. Because of the speed \\nwith which this model was launched and used \\nby an extremely large number of users, \\neducational environments have not yet had the \\nopportunity to alter their policies. It is \\nmentioned that ChatGPT does not intend to \\nreplace qualified instructors. According to the \\nprinciples \\nof \\nresponsibility, \\nit \\nshould \\nsupplement the information in the class and \\nprovide support to the students in applying \\nand testing the learned concepts. Among the \\nobjectives of education is the cultivation of \\ninterpersonal relationships, and both the \\nstudent-student relationship and the student-\\nteacher relationship play an important role \\neven in the learning process. It is important \\nthat the students are presented with the \\nworking mode of the ChatGPT in order to \\nknow both the opportunities that it can offer \\nand also the limitations that the model can \\nhave. \\nIn [20] the authors used ChatGPT to generate \\nresponses for specific disciplines. The \\nanswers were regenerated 5 times and then \\nthey checked the percentage of plagiarism \\nusing Turnitin. According to the analysis, the \\npercentages of plagiarism were between 0% \\nand 50%, which is why the rethinking of the \\nstudents\\' \\nevaluation \\nmethod \\nand \\nthe \\nassignment of homeworks was considered. \\nThey highlight the fact that students could \\ntake advantage of the existence of this model \\nto stop making efforts in the learning process \\nand even to try to pass the assignments using \\nthis model. They also support the fact that \\nused in the previously specified way, students \\ncould \\nbecome \\ndependent \\non \\nartificial \\nintelligence, and their development could be \\nstagnated both on a personal, educational and \\nprofessional level. In terms of opportunities, \\nstudents could use ChatGPT to organize their \\nideas and create a template that they can later \\nuse to implement the assignments. \\n10 \\n \\n \\nInformatica Economică vol. 27, no. 1/2023 \\nIn [21] the authors present the opportunities \\nthat ChatGPT brings to all types of users for \\nlearning(elementary school students, high \\nschool students, university students, groups \\nand remote learners) and for teaching as: \\npersonalized \\nlearning, \\nlesson \\nplanning, \\nlanguage learnings, research and writing, \\nprofessional development, assessment and \\nevaluation. But they are also made aware of \\nthe possible problems that could result from \\nthe use of this model. Among these are: the \\ndifficulty to distinguish between the text \\ngenerated by the model and that generated by \\na student, as ChatGPT has the ability to \\ngenerate text that cannot be identified by \\nplagiarism software, lack of understanding \\nand expertise, copyright issues. As presented, \\nChatGPT can be a great tool if it is used \\nproperly, \\nrespecting \\nits \\npurpose \\nof \\ncomplementing the information for the \\ndeepening of the concepts and a better \\nunderstanding. \\nIn [22] the author describes how ChatGPT can \\ncomplete the tests and exams offered to \\nstudents without being able to detect whether \\nthe text was written by a human or by artificial \\nintelligence. Currently, there is an application \\ndesigned precisely for detecting the use of \\nartificial intelligence in completing certain \\ntasks, but this is only at the beginning and the \\nlevel of accuracy is not yet concrete. Some \\neducational institutions are trying to rethink \\nthe way tests, exams and evaluations should \\nbe held. They argue that evaluations should \\navoid the use of the computer, be written on \\npaper, based on skills, real-time and oral. In \\ncontrast, \\nother \\neducational \\ninstitutions \\nencourage teachers to discuss with students \\nabout this tool and its limitations, as well as \\nhow to avoid plagiarism in order to respect the \\nethics of the universities. \\nIn [23] the authors present the impact that \\nChatGPT had on education, as well as the way \\nto \\ndetect \\ntext \\ngenerated \\nby \\nartificial \\nintelligence. According to their study, \\nstudents are predisposed to use artificial \\nintelligence to meet deadlines for various \\nassignments, which is why the idea of exams \\nbeing held in physical format without access \\nto \\ncomputers \\nhas \\nreturned. \\nThe \\n\"AICheatCheck\" \\nweb \\napplication \\nwas \\nlaunched to help teachers distinguish between \\nthe self-generated test and the one generated \\nby artificial intelligence. \\n \\n3.2 ChatGPT and Medical Domain \\nChatGPT also had an influence on the field of \\ne-health, especially on medical writings, and \\nfurther on we will analyze some articles \\nwritten based on this exposure. \\nIn [24] the author has analyzed numerous \\npublications \\nabout \\nthe implications \\nof \\nChatGPT in the medical field, including both \\nthe professional, the educational-medical and \\nthe research dedicated to e-health. In this \\nanalysis, he highlights the benefits that \\nChatGPT seems to bring to e-health, among \\nwhich we mention: improving medical \\nwriting, improving the research process \\n(researchers could invest more time in the \\npractical part of research), predicting diseases, \\nthe availability to explain to users what certain \\nmedical \\nconcepts \\nrepresent \\nin \\ntheir \\nunderstanding, and based on them ChatGPT \\nseems to be an effective tool for researchers. \\nOn the other hand, the risks, concerns and \\nlimitations of this model must also be taken \\ninto account. Some of these are represented \\nby: \\nlack \\nof \\nethics, \\noriginality \\nand \\ntransparency, plagiarism, and inaccurate \\nanswers can also have serious consequences. \\nThe lack of data confidentiality is another \\nimportant risk, as well as the fact that the \\nsource from which the model was prepared is \\nnot updated. In terms of medical education, if \\nused responsibly, ChatGPT could help \\nenormously in understanding the rigorous \\nconcepts specific to this field. In the \\nantithesis, it is considered to change the \\nevaluations that the students support in order \\nto avoid plagiarism as much as possible and \\nthe many negative effects it could have on \\neducation. \\nIn [25] the authors highlight the process that \\ntakes place in order to issue medical \\nguidelines. Issuing a guideline is a long-term \\nprocess that involves the selection of as many \\nreliable and accurate research sources as \\npossible. In this process, it is important that \\nthe issuer maintains the course of the purely \\nInformatica Economică vol. 27, no. 1/2023 \\n \\n11 \\nscientific guide, without directing the medical \\nresearch towards personal opinions regarding \\nthe researched field. Also, updating them is \\ndifficult, according to the authors, there is a \\npossibility that the information might not be \\nup-to-date between the start of the updating \\nprocess and the actual publication or the \\ninappropriate selection of data could affect the \\nveracity of the guideline. Having said that, \\nChatGPT seems to represent a promising tool \\nfor the medical future. It could optimize the \\nprocess of issuing guidelines taking into \\naccount the speed with which it can access the \\ndatabases, which would help doctors to focus \\nmore on the application of practices. Due to \\nthe conversational capacity with which this \\nmodel was implemented, ChatGPT can help \\npatients by explaining the implications of \\ndiseases, how they can be treated or how they \\ncould detect certain diseases. However, it is \\nnecessary to mention that ChatGPT should not \\nbe seen as a substitute for medical assistance, \\nbut as a supplement to it. \\nIn [26] the authors present how ChatGPT \\ncould be involved in the healthcare field in \\norder to help clinical professionals both in \\ndetecting diseases or treatments that need to \\nbe followed, as well as allow them to focus on \\nthe tasks that involve human decision-making. \\nAccording to them, ChatGPT can excel in \\ndrug discovery by identifying and classifying \\nchemical formulas. It can also provide cancer \\ntreatment based on magnetic resonance or \\npredict ageing related diseases. However,  the \\nmodel must be used responsibly, since the \\naccuracy of the data is not completely known \\nand the detection of certain diseases or \\ntreatments must also be done according to \\ninterrelation characteristics. As an example, \\nChatGPT is unable to diagnose patients with \\nmental illnesses because it lacks emotional \\nbehavior. \\nIn [27] the authors wanted to check if \\nChatGPT could be used in medicine that deals \\nwith the antimicrobial part. In this approach, \\nthey asked a series of questions to the model \\nin order to be able to conclude whether \\nChatGPT could identify all the scenarios. \\nAccording to them, the model was able to \\nidentify certain scenarios along with the \\npossible treatment, but there were also \\nexceptions in which ChatGPT provided \\nfeedback that could have endangered the \\npatient\\'s health. Thus, the integration of \\nChatGPT in antimicrobial medicine should be \\ndone with great caution, and it could not \\nreplace the consulting infection doctor. \\nIn [28] the authors begin the article with a \\nbrief presentation of ChatGPT as well as \\nhighlighting the possible advantages and \\ndisadvantages of its use in everyday life. \\nAlong the way, they tested the veracity of the \\nanswers that ChatGPT offered to questions \\nsuch as: What are the applications of NPL, \\nWhat will be the impact on health services and \\nWhat is the internet of orthopedic things and \\nits classification. The answers received from \\nChatGPT to the above-mentioned questions \\nwere compared with existing answers in the \\nliterature. According to them, used with \\ncaution, ChatGPT could have a positive \\nimpact on the medical industry, and another \\nhuge advantage is represented by the fact that \\nit could be used as a virtual assistant to help \\npotential patients when no other way of help \\nis available.  \\n \\n3.3 ChatGPT Used for Writing \\nWriting is another area where ChatGPT has \\nproven its effectiveness. Below are presented \\na series of articles that highlight this aspect. \\nIn  [29] the authors started from the premise \\nthat the use of LLM languages (Large \\nLanguage Models), such as ChatGPT, in \\nacademic writing can raise a number of \\nproblems related to the resulting content. It \\nwas highlighted that there are a number of \\nimportant challenges regarding: knowing the \\nreal contribution of a human author to the \\ncreation of a certain content, and the \\npossibility that human authors do not verify \\nthe veracity and correctness of the content \\ngenerated by LLM and take it as such. Based \\non these findings, the authors of the article \\nrecommended three safeguards regarding the \\ntransparency and credibility of content, \\nconsistent with the rules governing the use of \\ncontent-generating AI tools: information \\n(confirmation by the human author that he \\nused \\nLLM \\nfor \\ncontent \\ngeneration), \\n12 \\n \\n \\nInformatica Economică vol. 27, no. 1/2023 \\naccreditation (the exact contribution of LLMs \\nto the resulting content), verification (the \\ncontent generated by LLMs must be verified \\nby human authors). \\nIn [30] the authors carried out a study by \\nwhich they tried to verify if the use of \\nChatGPT allows the creation of publishable \\ncontent, comparable in quality to the peer-\\nreviewed content conceived by human authors \\nand published in journals. Thus, the authors \\ninvestigated the differences between content \\nconceived by human authors and content \\ngenerated by ChatGPT. Based on the premise \\nthat ChatGPT can produce a concise \\nintroductory section if given well-defined \\nrequirements, introductory sections from 327 \\npublished \\narticles \\nwere \\ncompared \\nto \\nintroductory sections produced via ChatGPT. \\nA methodological approach was used divided \\ninto two main sections: Data Description \\n(exploring ChatGPT\\'s ability to generate \\npublishable content requires the use of two \\ntypes of data, human-authored text and \\nChatGPT-generated text) and Analytical \\nMethods (two methods were used analytics \\nfor text data, i.e. supervised text mining and \\nunsupervised \\ntext \\nmining). \\nUsing \\ntext \\nclassification algorithms with high predictive \\naccuracy it was concluded that text generated \\nby ChatGPT differs significantly from that \\nconceived by human authors. \\nIn [31], the authors investigated whether it is \\npossible to train a machine learning model \\ncapable to disting between a small text written \\nby a human user and a similar text generated \\nby ChatGPT. Their study was based on short \\nreviews posted online. Thus, a methodology \\nconsisting of two modules was used. In the \\nfirst module, a machine-learning model \\ntrained to distinguish between human-created \\ntext fragments and text samples generated by \\nChatGPT was included, and in the second \\nmodule, an AI framework that allows the \\ninterpretation of the results provided by the \\nmachine-learning model. XAI (Explainable \\nArtificial Intelligence) was used to highlight \\nthe differences between the manner of writing \\na text specific to a human operator and \\nChatGPT respectively. For this purpose, two \\nexperiments were carried out, the first one \\nused text generated by ChatGPT through \\ncustom queries, and the second had as a \\nreference point text obtained by reformulating \\nreviews conceived by human users. It was \\nconcluded that it was more difficult for the \\nmachine learning model to distinguish \\nbetween human-conceived and ChatGPT-\\ngenerated reviews when the text obtained \\nfrom the reformulation of human user-\\nconceived reviews was used. \\nIn [32], the authors deal with the topic of using \\nChatGPT in scientific writing, emphasizing \\nthe utility of this tool for text generation on a \\nvery wide variety of topics. Thus, research \\narticles can be written and data and \\ninformation can be synthesized. ChatGPT can \\nsuggest the researcher appropriate titles for \\nthe paper he wants to develop, help him to \\ndraft it, and also proves useful in the process \\nof editing and summarizing the paper. \\nArtificial Intelligence does not allow the \\ngeneration of new ideas, but it can assist the \\nresearcher in organizing, synthesizing and \\ndeveloping their own. However, the authors \\nstate that, even if it represents an important \\nmoment in terms of the current stage of \\ndevelopment of the information society, the \\nautomatically generated text cannot yet \\nrepresent a substitute that replaces the \\nspecifically human capacity for thought and \\ncreation. It is concluded that, considering all \\nthese aspects, it is necessary to reach a \\nconsensus regarding the ways to regulate the \\nuse of chatbots in the field of scientific \\nwriting. \\nIn [33] the authors started from a very \\nimportant premise, namely that scientific \\ninformation can only be shared through a \\nlanguage, the emergence of language tools \\nbased on Artificial Intelligence representing a \\nreal revolution in the field of scientific \\ncommunication. ChatGPT is just one in a wide \\nrange of language tools, with others still in \\ndevelopment or to be released in the near \\nfuture. Although ChatGPT has proven a \\nmultitude of utilities, the quality of the text \\nstructure it creates can be misleading, as \\nreaders may be convinced that it is of human \\norigin and may pass over errors in the text \\nwithout further checking their veracity. \\nInformatica Economică vol. 27, no. 1/2023 \\n \\n13 \\nAdditionally, ChatGPT can make connections \\nthat don\\'t make any sense which can be very \\nconfusing for readers. The authors of the \\narticle pointed out that AI language bots are \\nunable to understand new information by not \\nbeing able to perform in-depth analysis, which \\ncan prove to be a limitation for the scientific \\ncharacter of a paper. Consequently, the \\nauthors offered a series of recommendations \\nthat can allow the realization of a scientific \\npaper to fully benefit from all the advantages \\nof using Artificial Intelligence. \\n \\n3.4 Using ChatGPT for Finance and \\nInvestments \\nIn the following, we will analyze some articles \\nregarding the impact that ChatGPT has on the \\nfinancial and investments field. \\nIn [34] the authors implemented a study \\nmethodology to test market efficiency using a \\nsample of AI-themed crypto-assets, for which \\nthey calculated an AI crypto index. The \\nCoinGecko portal was used as the data source \\nand 10 AI-themed samples were selected for \\nthe July – December period. According to the \\nresults obtained by them, the launch of the \\nChatGPT model led to an increase in returns \\nfor \\nmost \\nAI \\nbased \\ntokens \\nand \\nAI \\ncryptocurrency index. In contrast, during this \\nperiod the Bitcoin currency experienced a \\ndecrease in value.  \\nIn [35] the authors aimed to test the capacity \\nof the ChatGPT model in the financial field. \\nThis testing was carried out in several stages \\nin order to be able to cover areas such as \\nmeasure the financial literacy or advice \\nutilization. In parallel with ChatGPT, other \\nstandardized tools were used to be able to \\nconclude as precisely as possible the expected \\nresults compared to the real ones. According \\nto them, ChatGPT had accurate results in the \\nmeasurement of financial literacy, but the \\nresults were not good at all for tests involving \\ncalculations and these being said it is not \\nrecommended to use ChatGPT for the \\nfinancial field. \\nIn [36] the authors present the potential of \\nusing ChatGPT to optimize communication \\nbetween people with financial knowledge and \\nthose without financial knowledge, thus the \\npossibility of translating financial models into \\nterms that are easy to understand for any \\ncategory of public. Thus they analyzed the \\nanswers received from the ChatGPT model \\nfor financial terms such as: earnings to price, \\nalpha, beta, and illiquidity for which the \\nanswers were acceptable and easy to \\nunderstand. They also asked the model for an \\neasy-to-understand \\nexplanation \\nfor \\nany \\ncategory of people for a complicated financial \\nmodel. According to them, the limitations of \\nthe ChatGPT model must be taken into \\naccount in this field, as some of the answers \\ngenerated were inadequate or erroneous. \\n \\n4. Conclusions and Suggestions for Future \\nResearch \\nAccording to what has been presented up to \\nthis moment, it can be seen that the launch of \\nthe ChatGPT model represents the opening to \\na new world, the one in which humans \\ntogether with artificial intelligence could \\nimprove as many aspects of life as possible. \\nWe have already analyzed several areas of \\ngeneral interest in which ChatGPT could help \\nimprove them, but there are certainly many \\nmore areas for which this model could have an \\nimpact. \\nIn the future ChatGPT could definitely \\nimprove or even replace the consulting field. \\nTo support this hypothesis, we can only think \\nof the ability of this model to simulate a \\nconversation with a human and the large \\nvolume of data on which this model was \\nprepared. For example, ChatGPT could offer \\nsupport to a user who wants to make a \\nprofessional conversion but is not sure what \\nthis conversion would entail. At this moment, \\nChatGPT will definitely respond with a series \\nof steps that should be followed to achieve \\nthat goal and with a series of examples. \\nHaving this context, there is the possibility \\nthat users should first call ChatGPT and \\npossibly later call a specialized consultant. \\nHowever, it must be taken into account that \\nwe cannot rely 100% on the information \\nreceived from ChatGPT, not yet knowing the \\nlevel of correctness of the data used to \\ngenerate the answers, but we could certainly \\n14 \\n \\n \\nInformatica Economică vol. 27, no. 1/2023 \\nhave a starting point on which to continue the \\nresearch and a better understanding. \\nAnother field on which ChatGPT could have \\nan influence could be represented by e-\\ncommerce. \\nOf \\ncourse, \\na \\ncustomized \\nintegration would be needed for the respective \\nbusiness, but ChatGPT could be able to offer \\nsupport to the clients of e-commerce \\nplatforms, reducing the companies\\' costs \\nregarding trainings or personnel. On the other \\nhand, this aspect could have a negative impact \\non people, by the simple fact that there could \\nbe the possibility of their total or partial \\nreplacement. \\nThere should be a way for ChatGPT to be \\npresented to as many people as possible \\ntogether with the multiple advantages it offers \\nand examples of how its use could be leading \\nto higher productivity. But also for the \\nintegration of ChatGPT in the currently \\nexisting domains, it is necessary to issue a \\nmore detailed analysis on the possible \\nimpediments generated by this model. \\n \\nAcknowledgements \\nThis work was carried out through the Core \\nProgram within the National Research \\nDevelopment and Innovation Plan 2022-2027, \\ncarried out with the support of MCID, project \\nno. 23 38 01 01, \"Contributions to the \\nconsolidation \\nof \\nemerging \\ntechnologies \\nspecific to the Internet of Things and \\ncomplex systems\". \\n \\nReferences \\n[1] N.S.L.
